- Identify **underserved regions** within Ikpoba-Okha, enabling stakeholders to **identify gaps**.
- Support strategic planning for **infrastructure improvements** to better serve the community.

## Features

- **Geospatial Visualization**: Interactive maps are created using **Folium** to showcase healthcare facility distribution.
- **Targeted Analysis**: Focuses on the **Ikpoba-Okha LGA** for specific urban development insights.
- **Layering & Styling**: Custom map layers with color schemes are used to clearly differentiate boundaries and underserved areas.
- **Scalability**: The process is scalable for application to other regions or LGAs, facilitating broader urban planning and resource distribution.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The core programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For managing and analyzing tabular data.
- **GeoPandas**: Used for handling geospatial data, such as shapefiles.
- **Folium**: To create and style interactive maps with layered geospatial data.
- **Shapefiles**: Provides the boundary and geographical data for analysis.
